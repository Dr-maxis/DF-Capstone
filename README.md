# DF-Capstone
The final project for Digital Futures. 

Given one week make a 10 minuite presentation, gather data on a topic of your choosing analyse it and report back.

I chose to do my project about environmentalism. About the human aspect and symptoms of pollution.

This project will discuss the growing problem of pollution, energy consumption, and the consequences of ignoring the warning signs of those farsighted enough to see the clouds gathering over 126 years ago.

Note that the scope of the project is monumental and there was things I would have loved to discuss and implement however this would easily gone over a few hours worth of content.
